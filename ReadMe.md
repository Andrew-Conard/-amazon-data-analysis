# Amazon Product Data Analysis with Python

This project demonstrates my skills in Python by analyzing product data from Amazon. The analysis involves working with multiple datasets, identifying trends, and generating actionable insights.

## Project Overview

In this project, I performed the following tasks:
- Cleaned and processed raw product data
- Identified the top 10 products based on ratings and sales
- Generated alerts for products with low availability or critical status
- Organized data into easy-to-read tables for further analysis

The datasets contain information such as:
- **Product ID and Name**
- **Discounted and Actual Prices**
- **Ratings and Review Counts**
- **Categories and Alerts for Product Status**

## Files in the Repository

- **`amazon.xlsx`**: The raw Amazon product data.
- **`final_amazon_table.xlsx`**: A processed table with additional insights such as product alerts.
- **`top_10_products.xlsx`**: A summary table showing the top 10 products by ratings and performance.
- **`practice.py`**: The Python script used for data analysis and table generation.
